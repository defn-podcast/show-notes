## Eric Normand

**Questions:**
- Abstraction is hard to define, and you've pointed out that people use the word to mean different things. What are some of these common usages, and how would you define abstraction yourself?
- What are some examples of abstraction that Clojure programmers would be familiar with?
- What are some of the signs that abstraction might be premature? What are some of the signs that you probably need to start thinking about introducing abstraction?
