- Who is [@Kathryn Lawrence](https://clojurians.slack.com/team/U036AP3U9BM)?
- You gave a cool talk about [ASCII tarot cards](https://ascii-tarot.com) at one of the Pitch offsites. Can you tell us about the project?
- [Arthur C. Clarke's Third Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws) states that "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic," but what about the other way 'round? Is any sufficiently advanced magic indistinguishable from technology?

**Questions:**
- Abstraction is hard to define, and you've pointed out that people use the word to mean different things. What are some of these common usages, and how would you define abstraction yourself?
- What are some examples of abstraction that Clojure programmers would be familiar with?
- What are some of the signs that abstraction might be premature? What are some of the signs that you probably need to start thinking about introducing abstraction?
- How does abstraction relate to simplicity, which you've written about in your book "Grokking Simplicity"?
- How does abstraction come into play in your upcoming book, "[Runnable Specifications](https://ericnormand.me/domain-modeling)"?
